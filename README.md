#  FundMe Smart Contract

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built with **Solidity** and powered by the **Foundry** framework. Users can fund the contract with ETH, and only the contract owner can withdraw the funds. It is inspired by real-world dApps and designed to help me deepen my understanding of smart contracts, oracles, and Foundry scripting/testing workflows.

##  Project Goals

- Learn **Foundry** deeply through scripting, testing, and deployment
- Understand **Chainlink Price Feeds** for ETH/USD conversion
- Build a secure, gas-optimized **FundMe** contract
- Implement testing best practices using **Foundry's testing framework**
- Practice ownership and access control in Solidity
